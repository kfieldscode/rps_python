# rps_python

One of my first Python programs I made in early 2019!

A game of rock, paper, scissors with various player options in Python!
Play against: 
- Rock Player (always plays rock -- boring!)
- Random Player (picks moves at random)
- Cycle Player (cycles through moves)
- Reflect Player (plays the move that you previously played)

Complete with input validation, score taking, and object-oriented classes.
